## Description
The application deploys a book search engine that allows users to search for books stored in the Google Books API and also create an account and login to save and edit their favorite books. 

The application uses the Google Books API and uses React as the front-end, an Apollo/Node.js/Express server as the back-end, and a MongoDD database for storage.
